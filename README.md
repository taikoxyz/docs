# Taiko docs

Welcome to Taiko docs!

## Repo architecture

Here we will list the important folders within this repo.

### src/content

This is where we store all of the content.

### src/domain/chains

In this folder we define some networks (Sepolia, Holesky, Taiko) declaratively / strictly so we can work with it easily / safely.
