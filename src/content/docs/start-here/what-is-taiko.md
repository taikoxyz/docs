title: What is Taiko?
---

Taiko is a scaling solution for Ethereum. Fundamentally, Taiko strives to be as close to Ethereum as possible, making as few changes as possible.

But let's break down "What is Taiko" into some more specific components:

- Taiko Protocol: A **set of smart contracts** deployed on Ethereum which describe the Taiko protocol, a fully open source scaling solution for Ethereum.
- Taiko Labs: A **research & development group** that works on the Taiko protocol.
- Taiko Treasury: A treasury which is funded by the income generated by the Taiko protocol.
- Taiko DAO: A **group of Taiko Token (TKO) holders** which have the voting rights to govern various parts of the Taiko Protocol including smart contract upgrades, TKO parameters, and more. The Taiko DAO effectively controls **everything** (will expand more on this).
- Taiko Foundation: ?
- Taiko Security Council: ? Are these the guardian provers?
- Taiko Diplomats: ?
- Taiko Community: Various social groups / accounts run permissionlessly by anyone who desires it. Some examples include the Taiko Discord, Taiko Twitter, etc.

# scratch

- Ethereum has a scaling problem
- We believe in Ethereum's properties
- Rollups should extend these properties
- Thus we are building a based rollup that maintains those properties
- In a sense Taiko doesn't exist, it's a proxy between the user and Ethereum
- Based contestable rollup
- Based booster rollup
