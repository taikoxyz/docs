Taiko is a scaling solution for Ethereum. Fundamentally, Taiko strives to be as close to Ethereum as possible, making as few changes as possible.

## What Taiko

But let's break down "What is Taiko" into some more specific components. Fundamentally, Taiko is a set of smart contracts that are deployed on Ethereum. This is referred to as the **Taiko protocol**. There are also a few **organization** that govern these smart contracts, as well as some products maintained by the Taiko Labs team.

### The Taiko protocol

- **Taiko Protocol**: A set of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum which describe the Taiko protocol, a fully open source scaling solution for Ethereum.

### Organizations

- **Taiko Labs**: A research & development group that works on the Taiko protocol.
- **Taiko Treasury**: A treasury which is funded by the income generated by the Taiko protocol.
- **Taiko DAO**: A group of Taiko Token (TKO) holders which have the voting rights to govern various parts of the Taiko Protocol including smart contract upgrades, TKO parameters, and more. The Taiko DAO effectively controls **everything** (will expand more on this).
- **Taiko Foundation**: A Cayman Island entity that stewards the growth and development of the Taiko protocol and wider ecosystem. The foundation works solely for, and on behalf of, the Taiko DAO and token holders. Its responsibilities include, but are not limited to, financing of technical developments, ecosystem growth and maintenance, partnerships with service providers, events managements, and much more -- either through grants or other means. The foundation will do so with full transparency to the Taiko community and DAO.
- **Taiko Security Council**: An X-member council of individuals and entities elected by the Taiko DAO to undertake emergency actions on the Taiko protocol, as and when needed. The Security Council's core responsibility is to ensure the safety and soundness of the Taiko protocol, and as such it has the powers to implement upgrades or changes in pursuit of that objective. The Security Council also controls the Guardian Provers within the Taiko protocol.
- **Taiko Diplomats**: Inspired by Optimism's experiments with non-plutocratic governance and bicameral design, Taiko Diplomats are responsible for the allocation of Retroactive Public Goods Funding. Diplomats are elected by Taiko token holders and serve a set term for which they are compensated.
- **Taiko Community**: Various social groups / accounts run permissionlessly by anyone who desires it. Some examples include the Taiko Discord, Taiko Twitter, etc.

### Products operated by Taiko Labs

- Bridge UI
- Event indexer
- Relayer
- Block explorer
- Fork of Uniswap v4

## Why Taiko and the Taiko protocol

- Ethereum has a scaling problem
- We believe in Ethereum's properties
- Rollups should extend these properties
- Thus we are building a based rollup that maintains those properties
- Based contestable rollup: A configurable rollup to reduce transaction fees on Ethereum
- Based booster rollup: An innovative approach to native L1 scaling
