## Add tokens to your wallet

Find the token you want to import on the [addresses](/network-reference/addresses) page and use the address to add it to your wallet.

If the add buttons did not work, head over to the [RPC configuration](/network-reference/rpc-configuration) and [addresses reference](/network-reference/addresses) pages and add them to your wallet manually.
