This guide helps you setup your wallet to start using Taiko.

## Prerequisites

- You have a wallet installed (e.g., [Rabby](https://rabby.io/), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)).

## Troubleshooting

### The add buttons did not work

If the add buttons did not work you can first try using [chainid.network](https://chainid.network/). If that doesn't work either, head over to the [RPC reference](/network-reference/rpc-reference) and [Contract address reference](/network-reference/contract-address-reference) pages and add them to your wallet manually.
