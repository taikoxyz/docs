title: Receive tokens
---

This guide will help you receive testnet tokens. You can see all the deployed tokens in the [network address reference](/network-reference/addresses).

## Prerequisites

- You have a wallet installed (e.g., [Rabby](https://rabby.io/), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)).

## Receive some Holesky testnet Ether

Taiko is currently deployed on Holesky testnet. Check out [faucetlink.to](https://faucetlink.to/) for a list of faucets!

## Receive some Katla testnet tokens

HORSE is our deployed testnet token (you can see all deployed contracts [here](/network-reference/addresses)). Navigate to the [bridge](https://bridge.katla.taiko.xyz) and click "Faucet" on the sidebar to receive from HORSE.

## Receive some TTKOk

:::note
In order to receive TTKOk you need to have an SGX prover setup. We are working on an easy Docker setup to run the images if you have an SGX machine, and after verifying that you have an SGX machine we can send some TTKOk. Stay tuned for that!
