title: Receive tokens
---

This guide will help you receive testnet tokens. You can see all the deployed tokens in the [contract address reference](/network-reference/contract-address-reference).

## Prerequisites

- You have a wallet installed (e.g., [Rabby](https://rabby.io/), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)).

## Receive some testnet Ether (TODO: holesky from configuration)

Taiko is currently deployed on Holesky testnet. You can get testnet Ether from various faucets. We won't clutter this page with a bunch of faucets, as you can find them easily online.

Check out [faucetlink.to](https://faucetlink.to/) for a list of faucets!

## Receive some dummy testnet tokens (TODO: bridge from configuration)

HORSE is our deployed testnet token. Navigate to the [bridge](https://bridge.katla.taiko.xyz) and click "Faucet" on the sidebar to receive from HORSE.

## Receive some TTKOk

In order to receive TTKOk you need to have an SGX prover setup. See that here -> TODO(remove from here)
