This guide will help you receive testnet tokens on Holesky and Taiko.

## Prerequisites

- You have a wallet installed (e.g., [Rabby](https://rabby.io/), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)).

## Receive some Holesky testnet Ether

Taiko (Katla) is currently deployed on Holesky testnet. Check out [faucetlink.to](https://faucetlink.to/) for a list of Holesky ether faucets!

## Receive some Katla testnet tokens

HORSE is a dummy testnet token we deployed on Taiko (Katla). You can see all deployed contracts [here](/network-reference/addresses). Navigate to the [bridge](https://bridge.katla.taiko.xyz) and click "Faucet" on the sidebar to receive some HORSE.

## Receive some TTKOk

:::note
In order to receive TTKOk you need to have an SGX prover setup. We are working on an easy Docker setup to run the images if you have an SGX machine, and after verifying that you have an SGX machine we can send some TTKOk. Stay tuned for that!
