[Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) offers a streamlined solution for deploying smart contracts to any EVM-compatible chain, including Taiko. By simplifying the deployment process, Thirdweb enables developers to focus on building without the hassle of managing private keys, RPC URLs, or deployment scripts. This guide demonstrates deploying a `Lock smart contract` on Taiko using Thirdweb, highlighting the compatibility of Ethereum contracts with Taiko.

For a visual walkthrough, refer to our [video tutorial](https://www.loom.com/share/41dcd20628774d3bbcce5edf2647312f).

## Set up the environment

Before deploying a smart contract on Taiko with Thirdweb, ensure your contracts are ready in a folder or a Hardhat project.This setup can include a Hardhat project or any other structure where your contracts are organized. 

For setup details, see our [Hardhat Deployment](/guides/deploy-a-contract/using-hardhat/) guide on taiko.

## Deploying with Thirdweb

1. **Initialize Your Project**: Navigate to your smart contract project's root directory in the CLI and install Thirdweb globally using `npm i -g thirdweb`.

2. **Deploy Your Contract**: Execute `thirdweb deploy` in the CLI. This command initiates the deployment process.

3. **Authorize Your Device**: A browser window will prompt you to connect and authorize your wallet. This step ensures secure deployment from your chosen wallet.
