This guide will help you start up a Taiko RPC node using simple-taiko-node.

:::note
You currently **cannot** run a proposer / prover on Taiko's Katla testnet. This is because a proposer needs access to an SGX prover, and to be an SGX prover you need TTKOk. We expect to distribute TTKOk to those who have an SGX machine soon. Keep a lookout for updates on this! For now, you can run a **plain RPC node** which is mainly useful for fun / development purposes.
:::

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed and **running**.
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git/) is installed.
- If using Windows, you should install [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to use as your terminal.
- Meet the [Geth minimum hardware requirements](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum#hardware-requirements) except for the storage requirement because Taiko nodes will require less storage (at the time of writing).

## Steps

### 1. Clone simple-taiko-node

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Mac/Linux">
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node.git
    cd simple-taiko-node
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node.git
    cd simple-taiko-node git config core.autocrlf false
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Copy the sample .env files

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```

### 3. Set the L1 archive node endpoint

First, open the `.env` in your preferred text editor:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Mac/Linux">
    ```sh
    nano .env
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    ```sh
    notepad .env
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, you will set the L1 archive node endpoints.

:::note
You can use any Holesky L1 endpoint, but it must point to an archive node to access the state trie beyond the last 128 blocks.

It's recommended to [run a local Holesky node](/guides/run-a-holesky-node) but you browse around for other [Holesky RPC providers](https://chainlist.org/chain/17000). Keep in mind they will **eventually rate limit your node** and it will stop syncing, so a local L1 node is recommended for a proper setup.
:::

If you are running a local Holesky node, you cannot reference the L1 endpoints as `http://127.0.0.1:8545` and `ws://127.0.0.1:8546` because that is local to inside the simple-taiko-node Docker image. Depending on your firewall setup, you can do a few things. You can try:

- Using `host.docker.internal` (see: [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24319662))
- Using the private ip address of your machine (use something like `ip addr show` to get this ip address)

After getting the address of the Holesky archive node, set the following L1 node endpoints in your `.env` file:

- `L1_ENDPOINT_HTTP`
- `L1_ENDPOINT_WS`

Take a look at the comments above these values in the `.env.sample` to see how to set them up.

### 4. Start the node

:::note
  If you ran a testnet node previously make sure to first run `docker compose
  down -v` to remove the old volumes.
:::

Make sure Docker is running and then run the following command to start the node (you may need to use `sudo docker compose up -d` if your user is not in the `docker` group):

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

## Verify node is running

#### Option 1: Check with the node dashboard

A node dashboard will be running on `localhost` on the `GRAFANA_PORT` you set in your `.env` file, which defaults to `3001`: [http://localhost:3001/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview](http://localhost:3001/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview).

You can verify that your node is syncing by checking that the **chain head** on the dashboard is increasing. Once the chain head matches what's on the block explorer, you are fully synced.

#### Option 2: Check with curl commands

1. Check if the Execution Layer client is connected to Taiko L2:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8547 \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```

which should return the chainId as `0x28c60` (167008):

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "result": "0x28c5f" }
```

2. Check if the Execution Layer client is synced by requesting the latest Taiko L2 / L3 block from the Execution Layer client:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8547 \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```

3. If the blockNumber response value is `0` or not growing, check the Taiko L2 logs here:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

> Note: You may need to use `sudo docker compose logs -f` if you are not in the `docker` group.

## Video tutorial

See the video tutorial [Run a Taiko L2 node (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_tVvDcuK5o). It's for a previous testnet but the overall steps are the same!
